# Project Title
**Supabase Website clone**

# Overview

This project is a clone of the official Supabase website, built using React, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP for smooth animations. The goal of this project is to replicate the design and interactive features of the Supabase homepage, allowing users to explore the platform's key features and offerings.

The clone will include responsive layouts, dynamic animations, and interactive elements similar to the original website, showcasing the potential of React for building modern, scalable web applications with stunning animations powered by GSAP.
